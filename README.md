# CSS Basics Challenge

Step right up and practice your CSS styling skills!

## Instructions

Fork and clone this lab and open up `index.html` in your web browser. It's a plain-vanilla HTML page, with a set of instructions on each line.

Your job is to go through these instructions and apply the styling that each one asks for. For many of these, you'll need to use IDs and classes in order to be more specific.

The last few are a challenging - look back at the resources sections in the previous readings and use Google to search for clues!

**Good Luck**
